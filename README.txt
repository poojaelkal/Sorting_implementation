**Program Description:**
This project compares different sorting algorithms for cases when the input is randomly ordered, sorted in ascending order, and sorted in reverse order.

Algorithms implemented:

1.Insertion Sort

2.Merge Sort

3.Heap Sort

4.In-Place Quick Sort

5.Modified Quick Sort

**Instruction to run the Project:**

We have used Python language to implement the algorithm in PyCharm editor.

Each algorithm has been implemented in different files:

Insertion_Sort.py

Merge_Sort.py

Heap_Sort.py

Quick_Sort_Inplace.py

QuickSortMedian.py

Each program file finds average execution time for each input case (random, sorted, and reverse sorted), calculated on three different input data (generated using three different seeds), and plots the graph: Average Execution Time vs Input size.

Comparison of all sorting algorithms for each input case is implemented in different files:

Compare_Sorts.py

Compare_with_Sorted.py

Comparison_with_ReverseSorted.py

Each program file imports all of the sorting algorithm files and plots the graph: Average Execution Time vs Input size.
We have given size of the input in the array size[] in each file. If a different input size is needed, edit it in that array.


**Additional Notes:**

Each time, when you run a program code, make sure to close the previous plotted graph. This applies to Compare_Sorts.py, Compare_with_Sorted.py and Comparison_with_ReverseSorted.py files as well. when it starts to run, it will show graph for each algorithm. You have to close it to continue the execution.
If running in pycharm with scientific mode on, this step is not necessary.
